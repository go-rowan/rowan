## Installation

Rowan is distributed as a standard Go module and works with the Go toolchain out of the box.

To start using Rowan in your project, add it as a dependency using Go modules.

Run the following command in your project directory:

```
go get github.com/go-rowan/rowan
```

This will download Rowan and make it available for import in your Go code.

Rowan is a pure Go library and does not require any external system dependencies.
